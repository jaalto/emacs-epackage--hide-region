Description: hide or show regions like using kill-ring
    The function `hide-region-hide' hides the region. You can hide many
    different regions and they will be "marked" by two configurable
    strings (so that you know where the hidden text is).
    .
    The hidden regions is pushed on a kind of hide-region "ring".
    .
    The function `hide-region-unhide' unhides one region, starting
    with the last one you hid.
    .
    The best is to try it out. Test on the following:
    .
    Test region 1
    Test region 2
    Test region 3
    .
    If you are annoyed by the text getting "stuck" inside the hidden
    regions, call the function `hide-region-setup-keybindings' to setup
    local keybindings to a couple of functions trying to be smart and
    guessing if the point is inside a hidden region and if so, move out
    of it in the correct direction.
